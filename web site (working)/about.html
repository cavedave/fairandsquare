        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <h2>What does Fairandsquare.ie do?</h2>

        <p>At fairandsquare.ie we make Computer Aided Negotiation tools to allow people follow a process to divide collections of items between them. Our first fair division tool is for a separating couple to divide shared personal items</p>
         
        <p>The division of assets process the tool facilitates must be seen to be fair, transparent and quick by all the participants to reduce acrimony and speed up these negotiations.</p>

        <h2>Do you always get an item if you bid highest?</br>
        How do you decide who should get each item?</h2>
        <p>The allocation is done in a way that maximizes the person who gets the minimum. This acts like a tide that raises the level of all boats. Any other way of allocating will mean that someone is worse off than the worst off person in current the allocation.</br>
        Deciding allocations in this way comes from John Rawls’ Theory of Justice which says inequalities should be arranged so that "they are to be of the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximin_(philosophy)#Maximin_in_philosophy
        In the two-person case both people tend to end up with the same level of satisfaction. In the tools calculation the worst off person gets items until they meet the satisfaction level of the best off person.</p>

        <h2>What do you mean by fair?</h2>
        <p>With two people each aims to get at least 50% of any collection to be divided. This 50% is a fair share. Any more than this they get is an improvement the tool has found that increases peoples level of satisfaction.</p>

        <h2>Why do you measure what percent each item is desired rather than its money value?</h2>
        <p>Some things are really valuable but have little monetary value. We measure how much a person wants something but we do not ask whether it is for monetary, sentiment or some other reasons.</p>
         
    </article>

    <article>

        <h2>What if one item is really valuable?</h2>


        <p>Sometimes one item is worth the majority of the value to each person. It is possible no one can get a fair share because of this. For example is a house and some clothes had to be divided the house would be the vast majority of peoples values.</br> 
        Using our process we can find out this impasse quickly. Solutions exist to this problem of one non-divisible item is worth so much to prevent everyone getting a fair share. One is for the item to be sold and the cash proceeds become a divisible item. One is for a time-share arrangement to take place.</p>

        <h2>Do I have to do what the tool says?</h2>
        <p>No in any negotiation you have to be happy with the conclusion. Each person has to be happy the steps of the process makes sense and then that the outcome is reasonable. The people in the negotiation process have to decide what is agreeable.
        Isn’t it wrong that he got more than me?
        The tool tends to result in everyone having very similar levels of satisfaction. However there are cases where one person will end up more satisfied than others. If this happens and everyone has a fair share you could decide the division is still acceptable. If someone has much less than his or her fair share it will be because one item is of very high value <link to question on high value item>.</p>

        <h2>Why can’t everyone be equal?</h2>
        <p>Our tool produces divisions where each player is almost always within 2% of each other. Solutions where everyone is exactly equal on average have everyone getting about a third the satisfaction with the allocation.</br>
        We think a small inequality in the satisfaction level is worth a large amount more satisfaction.</p>

        <h2>What is a divisible good?</h2>
        <p>A divisible good is something like cash, cutlery or shares that can be divided up into many different parts. An indivisible good is something like a table, dog or television that must be kept in one piece.</p>

        <h2>How many items can be entered?</h2>
        <p>As many items as you want. But for a large number the system will become time consuming. The first dozen most important things are probably the ones people care about most. At the point where each item is not very valuable to either person picking one item each in order might be a faster. If each item is nearly equally valuable at this point little inefficiency will result.</p>

        <h2>Why doesn’t your system do X?</h2>
        <p>If you have suggestions for features you need for your problem we will be glad to help. If you have a process that will satisfy everyone in your negotiation and you want our help implementing it send us an email at info@fairandsquare.ie and we will try to help.</p>
