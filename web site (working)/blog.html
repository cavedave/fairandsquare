        <title>Can we replace Enda Kenny with a Robot?</title>
        <h2>Using FairandSquare.ie on the Croke Park negotiations</h2>
        <p>
        The Irish government want to cut <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2013/0218/1224330165084.html">one billion euro</a> from expenditure. The negotiations for the deal to reduce expenditure by cutting the pay bill to public servants are coming to a close. <a href="http://www.into.ie/ROI/FrequentlyAskedQuestionsFAQ/CrokeParkTalksFAQs/">The public service unions</a> do not to accept the need for cuts 'Where did the additional need for â‚¬1 billion in savings come from?
        ...The ICTU has consistently argued that the austerity programme would not work and has outlined an alternative view of how economic recovery can happen.' The situation is that goverment want to cut 1 billion and have given figures for where they want to make some of the cuts. 
        <p>
        The governments demands have been published in the <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2013/0216/breaking3.html">media</a>. The unions have not given figures but I will attempt to estimate how important they regard each issue. I made a table of what percentage importance the two sides place on each issue below. The government figures in the media are in tens of millions which I divided by ten to turn into percentages.

            Our negotiation aiding tool takes in valuations like above and gives a possible division of who should win on which issues.
        <p>
        My estimate of the importance of each issue is based on the following reasoning.
        <p>
        For the unions. Premium Pay 20% importance. I have heard this a lot on the radio recently which suggests it is something people are actually arguing over and not just ball hopping. Also people working on Sundays tend to be the front line workers who must be easier to defend in negotiations.
        <p>
        Sunday Staff Numbers related to the premium pay dispute and possibly just another way of rephrasing it. Say its important to the government and not as much to unions.
        <p>
        More hours will only reduce costs if it means less staff can be hired so in the one billion target its not that important. 
        <p>Flexitime and Redeployment will only allow cost reduction in conjunction with other things so I will stick these in as of fairly low importance.
        <p>
        Supervision has a figure on it from the government. Teachers are probably more powerful than their proportionate numbers as they are disproportionately represented in politics and in the people who help politicians going door to door. 
        <p>
        People earning 60 thousand plus one in six public servants are likely to have less public sympathy than those on lower wages. However some unions like those representing <a href="http://m.brne.ws/ireland/imo-new-croke-park-proposals-not-acceptable-585898.html">doctors</a> have a large number of members in this group. 

        <p>
        Increments are not discussed much which makes it look untouchable

        <p>Overtime seems a big issue especially to Garda.
        <p>Redundancies very little said about this which makes me think no one takes it as serious or likely. But the unions will want to say they stopped them happening which is a scalp I think they want.
        <p>
        If we put this estimated data into our system what would the results be? We converted the numbers out of 1000 million to percentages by removing a 0. Our system finds the maximin division that ensures each side ends up with the same amount. And that amount is as high as possible.  
        <p>
        Each side gets  57.6% of what they want with this calculation. These is compromise on Premium Pay and it is divided between both the government and the unions each getting a proportion. Premium Pay goes 57% to the government 43% to the unions. 

        <p>Specifically the items the unions win on and the amount they win on each are
             
        Premium Pay                8.6%</br></br>
        More Hours                  9%</br></br>
        Flexitime                   9%</br></br>
        Redeployment                9%</br></br>
        Overtime                   15%</br></br>
        Redundancies                7%</br></br>
        <p>

        and the government wins on and gains from each
        Premium Pay      9.7%</br></br>
        Sunday Staff #   12%</br></br>
        Supervision      12.5%</br></br>
        60k+             14.4%</br></br>
        Increments        9%</br></br>
        <p>
        In our system of negotiation with many dividable items only one is split between two parties. In these sorts of negotiations each side tends to take a small bit of each dividable item to be able to claim some progress even on that issue. Here is one estimate as to how the Croke Park negotiations might go. With more realistic figures on each sides desires we believe our systems estimate would get closer to the eventual negotiated settlement. We also think it could also do this quicker and cheaper than the current Croke Park negotiating system.
        <p>
        If you have any suggested modifications to these valuations from each side or any other comments please email info@fairandsquare.ie. We will have commenting turned on soon.
